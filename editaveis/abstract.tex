 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}


  This work will be analyzed methods and tools 
  providing reduced compile time
  programs written in C ++ in order to obtain more responses
  fast to changes in the code and reduce spending on resources
  (human, hardware and time) used in the process
  compilation. So this work consists of a
  Preliminary analysis methods and tools that can
  be used in conjunction with g++ compiler
  this reduction in compile time. The methods used
  this preliminary study was the inclusion guards,
  the implicit declaration of structures (forward declaration)
  and parallel processing through the make command.
  The methods analyzed resulted in an average reduction
  the compile time around 20\% and 40\%
