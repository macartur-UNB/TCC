 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

 This work will be analyzed methods and tools 
 that provide reduction in compile-time programs
 written in C ++ in order to obtain faster
 responses to changes in the code and reduce
 spending on resources (human, hardware and time)
 used in the process compilation.
 So this work is an analysis of methods and tools
 that can be used with the compiler in reducing
 compile time. The methods used in this work
 were to include guards, implicit declaration
 of structures (\ textit {forward declaration}),
 parallel processing with make,
 control optimization flags activation, and
 compiling aid tools(gold and ccache).
 These studies were applied in three different
 operating systems.
