   This work will be analyzed methods and tools
 that provide reduced time of compiling C ++ programs,
 in order to obtain faster responses to changes in the code,
 deallocate resources (human, hardware and time) used in the
 build process. Thus, this work consists of a preliminary
 analysis of methods and tools that can be used along with
 the g ++ compiler in order to provide a reduction in compile
 time. Some methods used in this preliminary study were:
 inclusion guards, implicit declaration of structures
 (Forward Declaration), and parallel processing with makefile.
  These analysis methods have produced an average reduction of
 compilation time between 20 \% and 40 \%,.
